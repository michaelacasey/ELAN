# ELAN
ELAN as an acronym stabds for Expert Lean Agile Navigator

The Cambridge Dictionary defines “Elan” as:
“a combination of style and energetic confidence or speed, especially in a performance or someone's behavior”

Why was ELAN created?

ELAN was created to provide support to people and organizations in the area of process, lean and agile adoption, SAFe implementation

The solution was designed to be:
	•	Affordable
	•	Customizable
	•	Simple yet scalable
	•	Sophisticated enough to ensure effectiveness

Its philosophy is encapsulated in the phrase:
Just enough, just now, just for us—tailored specifically to the unique context of your organization.

The Need for a Tailored Methodology

Every organization operates within a distinct context, with specific information and needs that must be reflected in its processes to ensure success. Effective methodologies must answer a critical question: Does this help?

Too often, well-intentioned rules and processes aimed at avoiding costly mistakes evolve into constraints that hinder productivity. This is not always because of the processes themselves but how they are applied.

From Theory to Practice

The success of any methodology lies in bridging the gap between theory and practice. It’s crucial that the daily operations of your business or mission are mirrored in your methodology. Only then can it serve your organization’s unique needs.

Key Considerations

To develop a methodology that works for your organization, consider the following:
	1.	Mandatory: What must always be included in your process?
	2.	Optional: What can be included if needed?
	3.	Discouraged: What should be avoided but not outright banned?
	4.	Excluded: What should never be part of the process?

Core Principles of ELAN are that it should be:

	•	Affordable: Keep costs low to ensure affordability and accessibility.
	•	Customizable: Support adapting the methodology to match the context of an organization
	•	Moderate: Provide just enough detail to be effective
	•	Easy: Make it straightforward and usable for all relevant stakeholders.

By adhering to these principles, ELAN ensures a practical, adaptable methodology that meets the unique demands of your organization.

The Important Characteristics of a Good Agile Methodology
A good Agile methodology possesses certain key characteristics that align with the principles and values outlined in the Agile Manifesto. These characteristics enable teams and organizations to deliver high-quality value to customers efficiently while remaining flexible and adaptive to change.

Quote: “How do you know your processes is any good?” - Dr. Allen Ward

	1.	Customer-Centric Approach:
	•	Focuses on delivering value to the customer early and continuously.
	•	Involves customers and stakeholders throughout the development process to ensure alignment with their needs.
	2.	Iterative and Incremental Development:
	•	Breaks work into small, manageable increments that can be delivered in short time frames (e.g., sprints or iterations).
	•	Allows teams to deliver functional product increments regularly, enabling frequent feedback and improvement.
	3.	Flexibility and Adaptability:
	•	Welcomes changing requirements, even late in development.
	•	Adapts plans and priorities based on new information, feedback, or market changes.
	4.	Collaborative and Cross-Functional Teams:
	•	Encourages collaboration among team members, customers, and stakeholders.
	•	Involves cross-functional teams that include diverse skill sets (e.g., developers, testers, designers) to ensure end-to-end ownership of delivery.
	5.	Empowered Teams and Decentralized Decision-Making:
	•	Teams are self-organizing and empowered to make decisions about how to accomplish their work.
	•	Promotes accountability and ownership of outcomes within the team.
	6.	Transparency:
	•	Provides visibility into work progress, challenges, and successes for all stakeholders.
	•	Uses tools like Kanban boards, burn-down charts, and sprint reviews to foster open communication.
	7.	Focus on Value Delivery:
	•	Prioritizes tasks and features that deliver the highest value to customers.
	•	Uses techniques like Minimum Viable Product (MVP) or Lean Startup to validate value early.
	8.	Frequent Feedback Loops:
	•	Encourages regular feedback from stakeholders, customers, and team members through reviews, retrospectives, and ongoing communication.
	•	Helps refine the product and processes to better meet needs and expectations.
	9.	Continuous Improvement:
	•	Incorporates lessons learned from retrospectives and feedback into future iterations.
	•	Encourages a culture of experimentation and learning, aiming for continuous enhancement of team performance and processes.
	10.	Simplicity:
	•	Strives for simplicity in design, execution, and communication.
	•	Avoids unnecessary complexity or processes that do not add value.
	11.	Test-Driven and Quality-Oriented:
	•	Emphasizes practices like Test-Driven Development (TDD), Continuous Integration (CI), and Continuous Delivery (CD) to ensure high-quality, defect-free outputs.
	•	Embeds quality checks into every stage of development.
	12.	Time-Boxed Delivery:
	•	Uses fixed time frames (e.g., sprints, iterations) to deliver small increments of work.
	•	Creates a sense of urgency and ensures consistent progress.
	13.	Alignment with Agile Values and Principles:
	•	Embodies the values of individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and responding to change.
	•	Promotes the principles of adaptability, collaboration, and sustainable pace.
	14.	Sustainable Pace:
	•	Ensures teams work at a pace that can be sustained over the long term, avoiding burnout and promoting team well-being.
	•	Supports a healthy balance between productivity and quality of life.
	15.	Lightweight Governance and Documentation:
	•	Minimizes unnecessary bureaucracy, focusing only on documentation and processes that add real value.
	•	Promotes iterative planning and decision-making, avoiding the constraints of heavy upfront planning.
	16.	Support for Scaling (if needed):
	•	Allows for scalability when applied in larger organizations or distributed teams, often using frameworks like SAFe, LeSS, or Scrum@Scale.
	•	Maintains Agile principles even as the scale of the organization or project grows.

Examples of Agile Methodologies with Good Characteristics

Several Agile methodologies exhibit these characteristics in different ways:
	•	Scrum: Focuses on iterative development, team collaboration, and regular feedback.
	•	Kanban: Emphasizes visual workflows, limiting work-in-progress, and continuous delivery.
	•	Extreme Programming (XP): Prioritizes technical excellence, collaboration, and frequent releases.
	•	SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework): Facilitates Agile practices at scale, aligning multiple teams and programs.

Conclusion

A good Agile methodology balances discipline and flexibility, allowing teams to respond to change while maintaining a focus on delivering value. It fosters a culture of collaboration, continuous learning, and customer satisfaction, ensuring that the team can adapt, improve, and thrive in a dynamic environment.
